            <p>
            We're excited you've joined us for our alpha release! An alpha
            release is basically a rough sketch. The core technology is built,
            but the there's a lot of fixing and polishing we still need to do.
            So, some things may not work as well as they should, but with your
            help we hope to make this amazing
            </p>

                <h4>Read secure emails!</h4>
                <p>
                With the Virtru plugin, you have the unique ability to read
                secure emails. Currently, writing secure emails is by

                emails, please sign up at <a

                <p>
                As one of our Elite Alpha users, you have the unique ability to read and write secure emails. Other individuals you send secure emails to will only be able to read your messages. Eventually, we'll allow everyone to read and write secure emails, but for now, we would like only you and other invited guests to test drive Virtru.
